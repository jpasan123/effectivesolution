Along with a like-minded group of engineers, he followed his dream of providing a solution to help solve medical conditions.

Straight out of university, in 2015, Keerthi co-founded Jendo Innovations with his co-inventors along with Heminda Jayaweera, and Vinod Samarawikrama to commercialize the invention. Keerthi, now 32, said 'another motive behind the formation of a registered company was to create a platform and provide opportunities for upcoming biomedical engineers in Sri Lanka to be a part of the Jendo Innovations journey and make good use of their intellectual resources and improve the overall standard of biomedical engineering in the country.'"

According to Keerthi, 'the screening price is affordable in comparison with other established procedures.' The company swiftly proceeded to apply for a patent, first in Sri Lanka (pending), then in the United States (granted: USPTO Patent 10,912,464 B2), and in Japan (Pending), through the WIPO Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).
